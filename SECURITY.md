Include the following:

    Clear description of the issue

    Steps to reproduce (with code or commands)

    Affected version or commit hash

    Severity rating (if known)

    Any known workarounds or suggestions for remediation

What to expect:

    You will receive an acknowledgment within 5 business days

    Investigation and triage will begin immediately

    You may be contacted for further clarification or validation

Responsible Disclosure Policy

Do not disclose any vulnerability publicly, in social media, in forums, or on issue trackers until a fix has been released and you have received written confirmation that public disclosure is permitted. This is to prevent exploitation in the wild and to protect users.

Anyone who discloses a vulnerability prematurely or maliciously may be banned from contributing to this and future projects, and may be subject to legal consequences if damages occur.

You may be publicly credited for responsible disclosures unless you request anonymity.
Scope and Expectations

This policy applies to all official source code, configuration files, and tool modules maintained by the project. Forks or unofficial versions are not covered.

Security vulnerabilities include but are not limited to:

    Remote code execution

    Unauthorized privilege escalation

    Insecure default configurations

    Insecure data storage or handling

    Information leakage

Minor issues such as console warnings or common misconfigurations may be noted, but may not be treated as critical or require urgent updates.
Legal Protections

Security researchers reporting vulnerabilities in good faith under this policy will not be subject to legal action. However, this protection does not extend to actions that:

    Involve exploitation of live systems

    Cause service disruptions or denial of service

    Result in unauthorized data access or exfiltration

    Violate applicable laws or terms of service

Act responsibly, operate within legal boundaries, and coordinate findings professionally.
